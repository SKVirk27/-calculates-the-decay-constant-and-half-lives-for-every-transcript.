Transcript Half-Lives Calculation

Description: This project focuses on calculating the decay constant and half-lives for yeast gene transcripts using time course data. The script processes the data to identify the top 10% genes with very high and very low half-lives.

Key Features:

Calculates decay constants and half-lives for each transcript.
Averages the half-lives from three time courses for final analysis.
Identifies top 10% genes with the highest and lowest half-lives.
Outputs include DecayTimecourse.csv, FinalHalflifeaverages.csv, Top10%_halflife.csv, and Bottom10%_halflife.csv.
Required Libraries: pandas, numpy, scipy, math

Execution:

Ensure the required files (DecayTimecourse.txt, main.py) are in the same folder.
Open the project in PyCharm and set the working folder as Assignment2.
Run main.py to execute the script and generate the desired output.
